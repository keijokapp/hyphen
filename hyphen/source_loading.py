"""This file contains logic for finding Haskell source that we might
want to compile and import.

In general, the preferred way of accessing Haskell code from Python
via hyphen is to install the Haskell code as a ghc-pkg registered
library; such libraries can always be directly imported into Python
with hyphen.

But you might want to have some Haskell source code in the same
directory as your python source, and then magically import Haskell
functions from that source. This is possible, but there are some
limitations. The basic issue is that to ensure type-safety, the
low-level layer must enforce that we only ever compile and import from
source *once* per program run. (Reason: Haskell will recompile the
source if it has changed, which might lead us to have
binary-incompatible objects floating around which the type system
thinks can be freely inter-substituted, leading to Problems.) So we
have to have a system for deciding which Haskell modules we want
compiled as part of this 'one shot' compilation.

We provide two options for this.

Option one is enabled by calling
hyphen.find_and_load_haskell_source. This looks in the directory of
the running script for Haskell source, and (if any is found) we will
also check subdirectories for more source, and (if any is found in a
subdirectory) we check sub-sub directories recursively. All the source
we find, we try to compile; if there are .hs files lying around which
are not valid source, we will get errors. Once compiled, we can import
the contents of these files from the hs.* namespace as usual.

This is meant to cover the case when you're writing a little script
and you want to import a little bespoke Haskell routine. It assumes
that you can control the contents of the directory where your script
lives; not an unreasonable assumption.

Option two is not really recommended. It covers the case where you're
writing a python library which is being imported from somewhere on the
python path and which (in turn) wants to import a little Haskell piece
of code that lives in the same directory. (As we've said, the
recommended way of handling this is to install the Haskell code as a
Haskell library visible form ghc-pkg, then to import it from
python... but we'll assume this isn't possible for you.) To enable
option two, call find_and_load_haskell_source(check_full_path=True) as
your python library module is imported. This will check the *entire
python path* for Haskell files (using the same rules as were used to
check the script directory above, including recursively reading
subdirectories). We then compile them and again they may be
imported. This is (a) somewhat slow, and (b) runs the risk that we'll
come across an .hs file somewhere in the path which isn't valid
Haskell and die.

[There is also option 0: don't call find_and_load_haskell_source, and
just access stuff from ghc-pkg visible libraries; and option 3: write
your own code, similar to the code in this module, which interfaces
directly with the low level layer, and sends it a precisely-chosen set
of .hs files to compile.]

Once find_and_load_haskell_source has been called,
find_and_load_haskell_source(check_full_path=True) cannot be called,
because we only get one shot at importing. (But if
find_and_load_haskell_source(check_full_path=True) has been called, we
can still do find_and_load_haskell_source because the former finds a
strict superset of the stuff found by the latter.)

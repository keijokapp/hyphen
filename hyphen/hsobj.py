"""This module defines the HsObj class. An HsObj object represents a
Haskell object; in general, hyphen will automatically marshall very
simple Haskell objects back into corresponding Python objects, but
only the very simplest objects are mashalled in this way (built in
types, basically); all other objects are represented as HsObjs.

The hslowlevel library already defines an HsObjRaw class which also
represents Haskell objects; HsObj is derived from it and just adds a
bunch of features (like definitions of __str__ and __call__) to make
the low-level version more friendly and easy to work with.

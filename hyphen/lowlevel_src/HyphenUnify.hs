-- | The main purpose of this file is to define a function for
-- unifying HsTypes. We describe what we mean by this. Supose we are
-- given a list of HsTypes. We imagine that their free variables are
-- drawn from a 'common namespace': that is, if we see an @a@ in one
-- and and @a@ in another, we think of them as the *same* @a@. (We can
-- always reduce to this situation by appropriate renaming.) Each of
-- these types is (except in degenerate cases) polymorphic. It's a
-- fact that if there's any type which is simultaneously an instance
-- of all these polymorphic types, there's a single 'most general'
-- polymorphic type T such that all other types which are
-- simultaneously instances of all our original polymorphic types will
-- in fact be instances of T. Our goal is to determine whether T
-- exists (i.e. whether any type which is simultaneously an instance
-- of all the original given types) and if so, to determine T and also
-- (incidentally) a map from the type variables used in the original
-- expression to the types that end up substituted for them in T.

-- This is done as the function Unify below. We build up various bits
-- of plumbing to allows to define it.

-- The ListWithFinial a b type is like [a]except that the empty list
-- has an instance of b attached.

data ListWithFinial a b = (:-:) !a !(ListWithFinial a b) | Final !b

addFinal :: [a] -> b -> ListWithFinial a b
addFinal []     b = Final b
addFinal (a:as) b = a :-: addFinal as b

reverseListWithFinial :: ListWithFinial a b -> (b, [a])
reverseListWithFinial l = rev l []
  where rev (Final b)  as = (b, as)
        rev (a :-: as) x  = rev as (a:x)

-- Our HsType representation is useful for many purposes; human
-- programmers tend to think of Haskell types as heads (usually type
-- constructors) applied to other types or to type variables (or a
-- mixture). This is certainly the interface we want to expose to
-- Python. BUT in it's technically (quite literally) completely
-- backward. The point is that type application is right associative
-- (so @Either a b@ is interpreted as @((Either a) b)@, so the 'parse
-- tree' of the type actually has as it's top node a binary node with
-- children @Either a@ and @b@. In other words, formally types want to
-- be read from right to left, not left to right, as HsType does (by
-- singling out the head for special treatment and by using a
-- list---which in Haskell is an intrinsically left-to-right data
-- structure---for the tail). So it's useful to have a reversed HsType
-- type, to which HsTypes can be freely round-tripped. We define this
-- now.
